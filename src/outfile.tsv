Question	Response	Baseline	Context
In the short story 'My Friend the Fish', what was the main characters name?	The main character's name in 'My Friend the Fish' is David Galbraith.	The main character's name in the short story 'My Friend the Fish' is not specified in the provided context.	At Chiemi's family, they also had many kinds of deep-fat fried fish in batter. This is also called tempura. It is served with a fish stock sauce mixed with soy sauce and a dab of grated radish. Of course, there was rice, but you had to put it in a tasty herb leaf with pieces of scrambled eggs, ham, and cucumber and hold it all in the leaf, and this ball you would dip in some kind of soy sauce. It was good.
I insisted I take the bus and the tram back by myself, and I got home in  of an hour.
Wednesday 17 August 1994 I taught 3 students from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM--a long stretch, one after the other.
Well, I'll get this segment in the mail. Love you all, xoxo Frieda
Thursday 18 August 1994, at 9:30 AM, Chiemi came by to say good-bye. She is leaving for the States tomorrow, so I'm on my own. At 10:00 AM I had my TOEFL student, Yoshiko. At 1:00 PM I had a conversation student, a 19year old boy who goes to a technical school, by the name of Takeda, and at 2:30 PM I had my high school student Yukimi, a very bright 15-year old girl. She just left and I'm trying to get this letter in the mail, but I might be too late (I was!). I am enjoying the teaching. They're all eager to learn. Yoshiko is also very bright and catches on fast. She is my go-between. She visited us that night with Datei in Provo. She is a high school teacher--really cute.
Well that brings me up-to-date on my journal. I have been sitting on the floor now for 12 days. Not once have I sat on a chair. Often I have such back cramps that I have to lie down flat sometimes to do things, just to get the kink out of my back. I love to sit on the floor, but it's hard if you don't have any choice, and there are no alternatives here.

It was busy, but enjoyable. The food was good. The boys returned about 5:00 pm from the Galilee. Daniel and Joel caught some big cat fish. It is also Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year). We also went to Bawden's apartment. They moved in today (quietly).

Here is Joel, too, with his catch in front of our home
Wednesday 30 September 1981 I cleaned up most of the day. Naomi went to a Primary party in Talpiot Park. I did my visiting teaching and gave the catfish to the Curryers. (I can still remember those cat fish today in 2015--they were the ugliest, slimiest fish and I was so glad to get them out of the house. To this day, I can't stand cat fish and their ugly whiskers.)

Thursday 1 October 1981 I had a RS meeting at Sister Aube's in the evening and took the kids to the play. Joel lost his money and Naomi's--2x16=$32. for 2 weeks. It was sad. It fell out of his underpants. Daniel stayed home, to help David move completely out of the Bethany home. We decided to move him to the basement.
Friday 2 October 1981 I cleaned house all afternoon and went to a talent show of the students at night. We had dinner and ice cream at the kibbutz. Daniel and I helped him move into the basement room. We gave his room to Tamara.

Then he introduced himself. To me he was a stranger and I also would not shake hands with him. That must have been very hard on him. I remember how he took out a handkerchief and wiped his eyes. Later I read a letter that he had sent to my mother from Germany and it talked about the little Filip (me!), and how I soon would not know him anymore. So how did that turn out? His side of the family called me after the other grandfather;

they had the right to call me that way as I was the first son, but I never went by that name; it was always Johann or Jan.
I also remember the beautiful books we got in school with beautiful, colored pictures. That was a first. I was fascinated by them. I felt I was in a different fantasy world. These books were written by two school teachers, Ligthart and Scheepstra. The present Queen Juliana or was it her mother, Wilhelmina (?) used to be in their school and she also read these primers. These were our first readers (Frieda's comment: I also had these in my first grades and remember dreaming of far away places like Indonesia.) I was quite poetic. I loved writing essays. I could write about anything and express my fantasies.
Did your father give you books? No, I only knew him very briefly, but I do remember something he did for me one time when I came home from school. A gust of wind had ripped off the sliding lid of my slate pencil case and it landed in the canal. We learned to put a bean with the moist sponge that we kept in the case, and see it slowly germinate. (Frieda's comment: I had one in first grade, too, in 1946, right after WW II when there was not much paper. I remember doing that bean experiment.) So I came home upset - the lid was gone. My father was there on one of his few visits and he asked the family for a piece of fire wood (Narve or Nerve). He would sometimes speak German with my grandfather.

It was an interesting lecture dealing with Russian names, full names, diminutives, diminutives of diminutives, diminutives for real intimacy, also the use of patronyms, how you would never introduce yourself. For example, I would never introduce myself to an audience as Frieda Galbraith, but as Frieda Johannova, which means, the daughter of Johann. That is the formal and proper way to do it here in Russia. As I mentioned earlier in my journal, you only use your last name, your family name, in passports or official documents. If a girl's name was Maria for example, in school she would be called Masha; that is the accepted diminutive for Maria; however, parents or husband or very close friends would call her Mashinka. If a girl's name were Sancha, she would be called Sanja or for extra intimacy Sanchinka. If a girl's name were Natalia, she could be called Natashia and Natashinka by closest friends. Bogdana would be Bogdasha at school or Bagdashinka at home. It was an interesting class lecture for all of us because we all live with families and have become aware of the name changes. Tamara and I stood for a while in a cafeteria line following the lecture and had a good eclair and a big nut cookie but the line didn't move and some people butted in so we decided to bag it and go home after the lecture. We left for home at 6:00 and played Scrabble at night with Bogdana and Masha, her neighbor girlfriend.

Wednesday 11 March 1992, today I finally caught up my journal. David and I had a good visit, and I am glad Tamara is now with me. I haven't written for nearly two weeks. I will start with today and then work back on whatever I do remember. This morning I went grocery shopping. I went at 8:00 AM, so that I could get in on the goodies. I had a good catch today. I bought about 10 liters of milk. (That is about 11 quarts) and one yogurt, and it cost me about 15 American cents.

Your Dad came home yesterday with a brand new fishing rod and reel ($15.00) for your mother and later he had one for Margaret, too. Your mother nearly fainted. $30.00! But everybody was happy. I like things like this. You're very much like your Dad--not so stingy and yet careful in general. Once in a while, an outburst--$30.00 for fishing rods is a lot, but since everybody was happy, it was worth it. John sure is different. I had to laugh yesterday. He didn't go to a dance, but just looked. He saved a dollar. I do like him. Don't think I am gossiping, but everyone knows this about him! He is so very, very careful. I surely appreciate you, darling. It'd make me nervous if you'd be that careful. I rather slow you down a little in spending too much than tell you that you're stingy. If you have something, you share it with others. John sits in a corner with his own (best) share and tries to eat it before anybody else claims what he has. It is funny to watch and rather innocent, but I can't help I'm happy that you are different. He might change when he is in love. Oh well, he is a nice boy anyway. You have things that Carol or others) won't like, but I don't care--nobody is perfect even though you and John think you are (haha).
Darling, 11 more days and you'll be here again and 13 more nights to sleep and 14 before you'll love me. It still is a long time. It seems like those last 2 weeks of waiting take ages. Maybe we have started to say 14 days when it still was 19 days and that's why it seems so long. I miss you, darling.
We went to the temple again last Tuesday. John came also. I think we'll go twice more. I really enjoy it, darling. Did you check for a ride for Grandma and did you get in touch with her?
